<p>Maria was raised in the Russian Orthodox Church (<a href="https://oca.org/"  target="_blank">OCA</a>) and has been an active participant with the Russians, the Greeks (<a href="https://www.goarch.org"  target="_blank">GOA</a>) and the Antiochians (<a href="http://antiochian.org/"  target="_blank">AOA</a>). She has been a choir member, chanter, youth minister, educator, and occasional preacher, essentially any form of church ministry open to women within Eastern Orthodoxy. Despite <a href="/academia/2016/10/07/Church-Joy-Built/">a strong call to the priesthood</a>, she remained Orthodox and instead focused her academic work on a contemporary argument for the ordination of women the priesthood rooted in both tradition, liturgy as an essential place of ethical formation, and contemporary understandings of sex and gender. She spent a number of years blogging the topic at <a href="http://deiprofundis.org" target="_blank">Dei Profundis</a>. She met her (now) wife in the Orthodox Church and they were subsequently excommunicated as a result of their relationship.</p>
<p>She continues to work as an an independent scholar focusing on ethics, gender, and sexuality, but currently supports her family by working in the technology industry. Scholarship remains important to her intellectual well-being, but her interest has always been in lived practices not simply theoretical discussion. She holds that nourishing theology and transformative practice ought to go hand in hand, and so is committed to ministry and the communal worship of the church as a source for subsequent theological reflection. Life and practice in the church has always been essential to her spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>Upon leaving Orthodoxy, she followed her wife to The Episcopal Church where they were immediately invited to exercise their gifts as welcome particpants in a vibrant community. She began the discerment process for ordination in 2014.</p>
<p>She is delighted beyond words to have found a home, and looks forward to making welcome and hospitality a cornerstone of her priestly ministry.</p>
<p>She continues to blog on occasion as member of the team at <a href="http://womenintheology.org" target="_blank">Women in Theology</a>.
