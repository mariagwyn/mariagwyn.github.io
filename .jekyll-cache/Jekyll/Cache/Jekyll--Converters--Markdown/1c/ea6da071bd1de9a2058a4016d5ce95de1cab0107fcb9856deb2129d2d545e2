<hr />

<p>This course introduces the field of Christian ethics by (1) studying major theoretical approaches focusing upon Anglican conceptions, and (2) exploring liberative ethics as critique and expansion of ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô conceptions. The course aims to advance students‚Äô theoretical knowledge in a way that provides resources for contemporary moral and liberative decision-making and pastoral leadership. The structure of the course will combine lectures with class discussions throughout. Evaluation will be based on short reflection papers, a final paper, and class participation.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Each assignment will be graded according to the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Writing Quality</strong>: Write as if your work will be made available to parishioners with whom you will work, whether printed in a church newsletter or as a part of adult formation. These are essays intended to help you communicate clearly. Use professional grammar, spelling, and punctuation.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus</strong>: Make a <em>single</em> argument. Answer a specific question, wrestle with a particular text, method, or issue. Stay focused. The goal is not necessarily to address all related issues, but pick something and think about it well.</li>
  <li><strong>Content</strong>: Ensure your work engages with the content of the class. Pick an ethical method or framework discussed in class or addressed in the reading. Your essays should not simply state <em>what</em> you believe, but <em>why</em>, and how your reasoning fits within or is challenged by and ethical framework.</li>
</ol>

<p>All written material should be in 12pt, Times New Roman, double spaced. Papers that go over the required length will be graded down a half a grade for every portion of page over the required length. There will be no exceptions to the length requirement.</p>

<h3 id="assignments">Assignments:</h3>
<h4 id="critical-engagement-responses">Critical Engagement Responses:</h4>
<p>Each session, a <strong>2 page critical engagement</strong> paper is due. This paper can address any aspect of the reading, and engagement questions are suggested for each session. These papers are short for a reason: no parishioner wants a 5 page answer to a question. They want a concise, thoughtful response that helps them continue thinking through a dilemma. The point is not to cover every aspect of the readings, but focus on an element that stood out to you for its insight, interest, inadequacy, or controversy so you understand how a particular author or method helps you think through ethical questions.
This critical engagement is evidenced by asking questions of the text itself, discovering or inferring an author‚Äôs assumptions and assessing them, considering the strengths and weaknesses of an author‚Äôs argument, and considering the text‚Äôs relevance to our developing understanding of ethics in your ministry context.
Please email the <strong>whole class</strong> at least four days before each session. Please send an email to all member with a subject that includes <strong>your name</strong>, the <strong>class name</strong>, and the <strong>session day</strong>. Please DO NOT reply to someone else‚Äôs email as a way of sharing your paper.
Please <strong>read the paper of your colleagues before you come to class!</strong> These papers will discussed by fellow students as a part of discussion sessions and so are a crucial part of the success of each session.</p>

<h4 id="final-project">Final project:</h4>
<p>Participants taking the course for credit will propose a final project from among the choices below. Your choice should be informed by which will be most useful to your ongoing educational development.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Projects proposals due: May 19th</strong>. A 1-page description of project summarizing topic, approach, and format. These will be discussed and reviewed in class.</li>
  <li><strong>Final project due: JUNE 20th</strong>.
Project Options:</li>
  <li>Option 1: write a 10‚Äê12 page paper on an ethical issue of your choice. The paper should summarize the key ethical dilemmas, and then make a case for a particular ethical response based on the thoughtful engagement with scripture, tradition, reason, and experience.</li>
  <li>Option 2: design a 12‚Äêweek Christian education course on Christian ethics, which might be taught at your home church. Write session titles and descriptions, what readings or media you might draw from for each session, and give an idea in 4‚Äê5 sentences of what each session would hope to cover.</li>
  <li>Option 3: write a series of 3 sermons on a particular ethical topic. As in any sermon, these should be prepared with worship in mind (in other words, they are not primarily academic). Each of the three sermons should focus on a different scripture passage, but each should in some way illuminate some facet of the ethical issue you are preaching on. It may be useful to choose lectionary texts to focus on in these sermons. Your sermons should be no more than about 1800 words.</li>
  <li>Option 4: propose your own final project! If none of the three options named above strikes you as helpful, propose another project.</li>
