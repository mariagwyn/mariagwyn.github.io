<h2>Research Interests</h2><hr />
<p>Exploring communal and ritually shaped ethical formation, drawing connections between Eastern Christian theological trajectories and contemporary concerns regarding sex, gender, and theological ethics. I am particularly interested in the possible intersections of gender theory, liberation theologies and Easter Christian spirituality and sacramental theology in the formation of theories of justice, human rights and the common good.</p>
