        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.

        <title>Seeing Gender: Orthodox Liturgy, Orthodox Personhood</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastern Orthodox theology affirms the liturgy as an anticipatory icon of God’s reign that establishes a pattern of relationships by which Christians are called to live in and for the world. Taking at face value an Orthodox theological claim that the liturgy is the sole source for deriving ethical actions, Orthodox theologians typically address the question of female priesthood within the existing visual parameters of the liturgy in which it is men who exercise authority. Given patterns addressed by both aspects of ritual theory and contemporary anthropology, the articulation of anthropologies that likewise limit the authority and capability of women are to be expected. However, these defenses of the exclusion of women from full participation in the liturgy, including sacramental ordination, are the result of a reductionistic view of the priesthood, the liturgy, and human persons. Neither Orthodox personalism, its ethical implications, nor a few rarely glimpsed snippets of the Orthodox tradition support such reductionism. Rather, recognition of the unique capabilities of women by the community and their welcome participation within the community encourages the joy which underlies the transformation of a people who live for the life of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Iconicity of Priesthood: Male Bodies or Embodied Virtue?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late-ancient theologies of the priesthood frame its tasks, virtues and metaphorical relationships around its chief task: encouraging a common life of &lt;em&gt;theosis&lt;/em&gt; as embodied virtue. Metaphorical relationships are used to evoke the manner in which, and the virtue with which, priestly tasks are to be practiced. In the priest, we hope to see an icon of the deified humanity to which all are called. This theological structuring allows the participation of women in the sacramental priesthood. Modern Orthodox arguments, in their efforts to defend an exclusively male priesthood, subvert this structure. The language of relationship and virtue is used to define the priesthood according to specifically gendered tasks. This theology results in, and derives from, a reduced view of the full personhood of women and the breadth of the priestly task, undermining the priest’s role of embodying and encouraging all the virtues of the deified life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Body &amp; Worship</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bookcover_womeninpriesthood2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My helpful screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hopko&quot;&gt;Fr. Thomas Hopko&lt;/a&gt;, in the most recent edition of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Women-Priesthood-Thomas-Hopko/dp/0881411469&quot;&gt;Women and the Priesthood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; comments that ordaining a woman is tantamount to ordaining criminals and the disabled, both of which he considers problematic.  Thus, the following thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no perfect body.  Every body is frail, broken, or breaking.  How many priests stand before God in perfect health?  How many of our priests are obese, have high blood pressure, weak backs, a rash?  Is the priest whose body is ravaged by cancer no longer able to present the sacraments because his body will soon bring an end to his present life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of God is not dependant on the perfection of our bodies.  At some level, we are all dis-abled.  For some, our disabilities are significant enough that we cannot perform particular tasks.  And, perhaps, one of these tasks is to preside at the Eucharist.  But disability itself cannot prevent the movement of the Spirit.  To think otherwise is to limit God according to our weaknesses.  Note &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christos_Yannaras&quot;&gt;Christos Yannaras&lt;/a&gt;’ defense of the canon law which forbids the ordination of men who were raped as children.  Who or what triumphs in this theology?  A God who becomes a broken body, and by doing so, enabling matter to participate in the divine, or simply a broken body?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Today</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the first day of spring, the second tuesday of lent or perhaps the entrance into Holy Week (depending on your geography), and a beautiful but chilly day in Boston.  So much for spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I am a graduate student in theological ethics at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bc.edu/info&quot;&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt;, officially ABD!  I am also vaguely ADD, which is why I am introducing myself to myself in a blog, rather than cranking out the proposal, or hanging out with friends.  Actually, given the season, everyone is about to scatter to celebrate the season with friends and family.  The nice thing about BC is that it grants an Easter break.  The bummer is that it is not my Easter.  Pascha this year falls somewhere at the end of eternity, otherwise known as April.  At least by then, spring will arrive and the resurrection will be mirrored in the fecundity and renewal of nature, at least to my flower-starved eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already hinted at, today I am also a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church, specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stmaryorthodoxchurch.org&quot;&gt;St. Mary Antiochian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge, Mass.  Who knows what tomorrow will bring, but today I am delighted and relieved to be a part of an ethnically and generationally diverse, english-speaking, vibrant congregation.  A rarity in my experience of Orthodoxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough for today.&lt;/p&gt;
