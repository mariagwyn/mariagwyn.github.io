excerpt: "Tradition holds, that every human being is in the image of God, but it does not define exactly in what this image consists. --Epiphanius of Salamas"

<blockquote>Tradition holds, that every human being is in the image of God, but it does not define exactly in what this image consists.
- Epiphanius of Salamas (d. 403)</blockquote>
<blockquote>The human person is an icon of God, a finite expression of God’s infinite self-expression. – Kallistos Ware</blockquote>
<blockquote>[Likeness is] the entire path along which the image develops the agency of the human will stimulated and assisted by the grace of God. – Dumitru Stăniloae</blockquote>
<blockquote>Our conscious self-awareness; our powers of reason, introspection, and intuitive insight; our conscience; and our sense of good and evil. – Kallistos Ware</blockquote>
<blockquote>No single component of the human being possesses the quality of being image by itself alone, but only in so far as the whole person manifests himself through each part and action. – Dumitru Stăniloae
</blockquote>
